### Python Node Editor (PNE)

Let's say your python project is too flexible/modular to keep re-writing a frontend for it. Or maybe you don't want to keep looking at code while you're running some python functions you wrote while tweaking the inputs.

To make functions usable on the frontend, all you have to do is fully type annotate them.

Please See the [Basic Usage](https://github.com/tristanryerparke/python-node-editor/wiki/Basic-Usage) wiki page to get started.
